          <blockquote class="lead quote text-center">&ldquo;GDS has been amazing to work with in the prep for FireConf this year. They delivered on a design language for the event that led to a memorable new look and feel. GDS drives many of the event work streams, turning all the tracks into a consistent experience. For each work stream they involve us in the level we are most comfortable with, whether that is only for critical reviews and LGTMs, or by having more frequent interactions and work processes. Finally, they have been extremely supportive of creative ideas for the event and have been "yes and" every step of the way. Thanks for bringing the ultimate Googler mentality GDS!&rdquo;</blockquote>
